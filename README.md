5 User Stories:
// try adding a role to each user story. Going forward you may be doing the same thing to two different roles. Other than that, looks great.
1.  Create a submit area that will test if the trivia question is answered correctly.
2.  Create an area that accurately keeps track of the number of questions answered correctly.
3. Create an area that accurately keeps track of the number of questions answered incorrectly.
4. Create a next question button that brings up a new trivia question.
5. If a question is answered correctly or incorrectly, the answer will be displayed along with writing that the question was answer correctly or incorrectly.

INSTRUCTIONS:

This is a trivia game that has three different categories:
  -General
  -Sports
  -Geography

The game starts loaded with the general trivia question set but you can switch the set by clicking any of the other buttons at the top.  To start each set, press the "click to start" area.  You will have one chance to answer each question in the set unless you reset the game.  When the questions run out, the game will prompt you to either click a new card set or reset the game.

Please type your answers in the input area and make sure they are spelled correctly.  The answers are not case sensitive.

THINGS TO WORK ON:

Ideally there would be a lot more questions in the decks as well as categories to choose from.  I would also like to add some functionality where the answers did not have to be the exact spelling.  There are some answers where a plural would be valid or adding a the would be grammatically correct but the answer will only accept what is typed in the object letter for letter.  I would also like to add a feature that is a sort of timer or counter where it can evaluate what level you have reached.

// yeah you could code different levels of leniency. I would recommend using something like regular expressions.
